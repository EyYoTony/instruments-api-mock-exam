# Instruments API Guide

## Getting Started
  This guide will show you how to start up your own version of this API server

### Clone the repo
  First you need to make a local copy of the repo:
  - `git clone https://github.com/EyYoTony/instruments-api-mock-exam.git <directory name>`
  - `cd <directory name>`

### Install dependencies
  Now you need to install all of the node modules required to run the API <br />
  You can either run `npm install` or `yarn` <br />
  I use `npm install`, because yarn doesn't want to cooperate with a windows env

### Establish environment variables
  You now need to add a `.env` file to store your environment variables <br />
  This file name is already in the `.gitignore` file, so it won't show up in your own git repo <br />
  Now fill the `.env` file like this:
  > COUCHDB_URL=(DB url) </br>
  > COUCHDB_NAME=(DB name) </br>
  > PORT=(default port) </br>

### Load data
  There is a `load-data.js` file to help you fill your db with example data </br>
  You can run this file by either using the `npm run load` or `node load-data.js` commands

### Load indexes
  You can load indexes to your pouch db to allow for faster searches sorted by that index type </br>
  To run the `load-indexes.js` file, you can either use the `npm run loadIndex` or `node load-indexes.js` commands

### Start the API
  Finally to start the API, run the `npm start` command
